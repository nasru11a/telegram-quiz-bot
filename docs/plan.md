## Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive improvement plan for the Telegram Quiz Bot project. Based on an analysis of the current codebase and the requirements documented in `requirements.md`, this plan identifies key areas for enhancement and provides specific recommendations for implementation. The plan is organized by themes to facilitate a structured approach to improvements.

## 1. Architecture and Code Structure

### Current State
The application is built using Spring Boot with a standard layered architecture (controller/handler, service, repository). It uses a PostgreSQL database for persistence and is containerized with Docker. The codebase follows basic object-oriented principles but has room for improvement in terms of organization and best practices.

### Improvement Goals

4. **Monitoring and Alerting**
   - Implement comprehensive logging
   - Add performance metrics collection
   - Set up alerting for performance degradation
   - Create dashboards for system health visualization

## 5. Security
